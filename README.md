# LED-Clock
A Clock made from an 11 x 27 ARGB - LED Strip Matrix using an Arduino

WIRING DIAGRAMMS
There are different ways to wire the clock. At this moment, there is only the software for Wiring Diagramm 1. The Software
for Diagramm 2, 3 and 4 will follow in a few days. Please make sure to use the right Software!

TIME
In my code, there ist only a default time setted, which the clock shows. There are a few examples how to get
the current time. These are in the code.
